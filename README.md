# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction – Albany Real Estate

This project uses linear regression to predict housing prices in Albany, NY, based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location attributes.

## 📊 Project Description

The objective of this analysis is to build a predictive model using linear regression on a real estate dataset. The dataset includes housing attributes and sale prices, enabling the model to estimate price trends and deliver valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, or investors.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from a real estate listings platform and includes the following features:

- `square_feet`: Total area of the house
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `location`: Area of the house
- `price`: Sale price of the house (Target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and irrelevant columns
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualized price trends and feature correlations
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selected top contributing features
4. **Model Building** – Applied linear regression and evaluated using R² and RMSE
5. **Prediction** – Used the trained model to predict prices for unseen data

## 📈 Results

- Achieved good model performance with logical feature correlations.
- Visualization highlighted significant predictors of housing price like square footage and number of bedrooms.

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Try advanced regression models (Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

## 📎 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook file in Jupyter/Colab
3. Run all cells to see data analysis and prediction
